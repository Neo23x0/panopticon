# Panopticon

A YARA rule performance measurement tool

## What it does 

It runs a YARA rule set against a set of samples and measures the duration of a set of cycles over that sample set. 

Bad rules are the ones with bad atom quality as explained in [YARA Performance Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/Neo23x0/e3d4e316d7441d9143c7). They slow down the whole search as more data needs to be evaluated by the YARA engine. YARA complains by itself about some rules slowing down the search, e.g. if they contain a regex with .* but [^a]* isn't alerted but equally bad.

The number of iterations over the sample set gets evaluated automatically by providing the number of seconds each rule should be tested against the sample set (default: 30). 

## Usage

```bash
usage: panopticon.py [-h] [-f yara files [yara files ...]]
                     [-d yara files [yara files ...]] [-l logfile]
                     [-i iterations] [-s seconds] [-c baseline_calib_times]
                     [-m baseline_test_times] [-S] [-a A]

YARA RULE PERFORMANCE TESTER

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f yara files [yara files ...]
                        Path to input files (YARA rules, separated by space)
  -d yara files [yara files ...]
                        Path to input directory (YARA rules folders, separated
                        by space)
  -l logfile            Log file (default: panopticon.log)
  -i iterations         Number of iterations (default: auto)
  -s seconds            Number of seconds to spend for each rule's measurement
  -c baseline_calib_times
                        How often to run the iterations on the calibration
                        rule
  -m baseline_test_times
                        Number of normal runs to measure accuracy of
                        calibration rule
  -S                    Slow mode, don't skip rule on first quick scan
  -a A                  Alert bonus in percent: Only alert rules which slow
                        down scans by this much percent (+ measured
                        inaccuracy)

```

## Prerequisites

You need to find/build a good sample set that reflects best the use case in which you plan to use your YARA rules. Copy about 10-100 MB of the usual files into the samples directory, e.g. some exe, elf, doc, txt, php, ... This should not be malware or cause any matches because the processing of them would skew the results if some rules fire and some don't.

The baseline.yar should contain at least 50 rules to prevent single rules with lots of strings to cause a relative slowdown of the scanning. 

## Considerations 

The measurements are influenced by the system load. If you run this on your Desktop system with many different running and active processes, the results can be distorted. 

The more seconds you give the measurements (parameter -s ), the better are the results. In fast mode (default) panopticon will stop measuring a rule, as soon as one scan was fast enough. So a high value here doesn't mean, that the whole test will take long, but it will give better results.

Give the panopticon process maximum priority in the OS, e.g. "chrt -r 99 ./panopticon.py" (if your kernel has realtime extension) or "nice -n -20 ./panopticon.py" on Linux.

### On Linux: Reserving a physical CPU core
Follow instructions on https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/326579/how-to-ensure-exclusive-cpu-availability-for-a-running-process to exclude all virtual cores of a physical core from the normal scheduler. See "core id" in the output of "cat /proc/cpuinfo", e.g. on a core i7 processors 3 and 7 share core id 3. After report start with:

```bash
chrt -r 99 taskset -c 7 ./panopticon.py
```

This command should show several kernel processes (square bracket) but only one in userland (no square brackets):

```bash
ps -eo psr,command | tr -s " " | grep "^ [3|7]"
```

## Getting Started 

1. Clone this repo and cd to it `git clone https://github.com/Neo23x0/panopticon.git && cd panopticon`
2. Install the requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place your samples into the `./samples` sub folder (see section "Prerequisites" for help on that matter) 
4. Start a measurement with `python3 panopticon.py -f your-yara-rules.yar`

### Example

Try the `test-rules.yar` that are included in this repository. 

```bash
python panopticon.py -f test-rules.yar
```

## yara_mem_usage.py

yara_mem_usage.py is a small script which measures the difference in used memory before and after loading and compiling a .yar file using 2 different methods.

Example:
```bash
$ ./yara_mem_usage.py all.yar
all.yar: psutil: 17,464 KB -- resource:  17,476 KB
